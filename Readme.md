# Explorations of the Baseball Stats Database
The notebooks in this repo step you through how to use and document the `lahman2016.sqlite` database. 
- Part 1 is a light primer on SQLite.
- Part 2 is an ERD-drawing exercise (so we can visualize the database).  

__These exercises are intended to complement the class lectures. DO NOT START THEM EARLY.__
